# Overnight campaign: improving n^{O(log d)} (started 2026-11-04)

Goal set by the user: push the conditional n^{O(log d)} bound for graph isomorphism of maximum degree d
(Theorem R*, see verify-theorem-R.md and redteam-theorem-R.md) further, ideally toward polynomial,
with 2-3 agents at a time. Framing: polynomial for all d would put GI in P; f(d)·poly(n) (FPT in the
degree) is a recognized open problem. Every claim is labeled proven / sketched / speculative, and
claimed results get an independent red-team pass.

## Wave 1
* w1-fpt: source of the log d factor; amortization attempts; lower bounds for the algorithm class.
* w1-structure: replace enumeration of non-Cameron primitive quotients (affine groups etc.) by
  structure; polynomial time for d = O(log n)?
* w1-scale: bounded-degree pipeline at n in the thousands; instances hard for nauty.
